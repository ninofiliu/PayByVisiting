# Pay By Visiting

## What is it?

**Pay By Visiting** (PBV) is a project by Nino Filiu where people can pay other persons simply by visiting a website. The principle is simple: Alice visits Bob's site where PBV is implemented. While she is online, her computer is giving away part of its computing power to resolves a problem that interests Bob. Eventhough money is not directly created, both Alice and Bob find three major perks to this implementation:

+ **Extreme simplicity**
Bob simply has to copy-paste a few lines of codes in his website files in order for the whole thing to work - most payment implementations require a deep understanding of server communication to be implemented and are usually not free. Alice doesn't have to enter critical information and simply has to visit a website.
+ **No money involved**
When raising funds or asking for financiary help, the hardest stage to pass is to go from a "I support you" to "I support you, here is one dollar". With PBV, users are often willing to support a third party because it doesn't feels like any money is being spent.
+ **Complete anonimity**
Many websites afford their web traffick through cookies - which are considered by many as downright scary in terms of privacy, and rightly so. With PBV, absolutely no personnal information is exchanged.

Many find it quite debatable at first glance how Bob can make actual money out of computing power, but lately they are closely related. A growing number of applications (weather forecasting, molecular dynamics, aerodynamics research...) use supercomputers which can cost up to hundreds of millions of dollars - and stay profitable. Here, the distributed computing power is used to build rainbow tables but that can be easily changed.

## How is the project going?

The project has begun on the 9th of October 2017, so it is not a billion dollar industry yet (/^â–½^)/

A first implementation of PBV is available [here](https://ninofiliu.fr/pbv/).!
